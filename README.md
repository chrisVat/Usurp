# Usurp
Coresets for Supervised Learning using Unsupservised Learning

run main.py to try the code  
subset_sampler has different coreset sampling techniques  
distances is for getting distance from embeddings  

# TODO:  
Get code to save embeddings given contrastive model   
Get code to train contrastive model / load trained model   
Explore different sampling techniques
