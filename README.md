# Usurp
Coresets for Supervised Learning using Unsupservised Learning

First generate embeddings for your data as a np file, then use save_distances.py to do clustering.  
Then you can use those distances with main.py for coreset selection.    
I am using python 3.10.4  

# TODO:     
Explore different sampling techniques
